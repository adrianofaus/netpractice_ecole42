# Library Forty Two

* [Introduction](#introduction)
* [Notion](#notion-link)
* [Libc Clone](#libc-clone)
* [Not standard Libc Functions](#not-standard-libc-functions)
* [Linked List Functions](#linked-list-functions)

## Skills that I have improved

* Rigor
* Imperative programming
* Algorithms & AI

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to code my own C Library, that will be used along the 42 course. 
* Firstly, I made my own version of some useful functions from libc, that was considered the first part of the project.
* Secondly, It was asked to code functions that were not included in the original libc, most of the functions would help us to deal with strings.
* Lastly, I made functions to deal with linked lists. That was the first time I've ever dealt with data structures other than arrays.
* After the project was done I could include any functions I wanted but I had to made them from skratch.

## How to run it?

```
# Clone the repository
https://github.com/adrianofaus/Projects_42_School.git

cd Projects_42_School/1.Libft

# Run the makefile
make

# Header of libft
Add the libft.h header

# Compile your program with the library
clang main.c libft.a

# Execute the resulted binary
./a.out

# Clean binary and object file
make fclean

# Clean object files
make clean

# Re-compile
make re

```
